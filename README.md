It must cover AI's detection methods (biometric/behavioral), its primary utility as a complementary tool, and cite the evidence of its success in the healthcare sector."

**Refined Content Output (Abstract):**
### Abstract: Effectiveness and Mechanism of AI in Stress Management

[cite_start]Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing personal well-being by offering intelligent, scalable, and personalized stress management support[cite: 9, 10]. This paper examines AI's dual mechanism for intervention: **detection** and **delivery**. [cite_start]Detection is achieved proactively through **Biometric Signal Processing**, analyzing data from wearables like heart rate variability and sleep patterns, and **Behavioral Data Analysis**, monitoring digital interaction patterns such as typing speed and communication tone[cite: 43, 47, 49]. [cite_start]This allows AI to anticipate stress and trigger personalized interventions, including micro-break prompts[cite: 45, 53]. [cite_start]While effective, AI functions primarily as a **complementary tool** to human therapists, providing accessible, 24/7 support and structured exercises[cite: 15, 36, 38]. [cite_start]Evidence supports this approach: a study involving 120 nurses demonstrated that AI-tailored mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions significantly **reduced burnout rates** in this high-stress profession, validating the technology's potential for tangible stress reduction[cite: 64].

### 3. Multiple Versions (Varying Focus/Tone)

| Prompt Change | Output Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt V3:** "Focus the paper section on **AI detection methods** and the *proactive* benefit. Use an **informative, highly technical tone**." | [cite_start]Output emphasizes **Pattern Recognition** across diverse data points, noting how advanced algorithms identify subtle patterns *before* the individual consciously recognizes the stress[cite: 49, 50]. [cite_start]Details are given on monitoring **typing speed** and **tone of written communications**[cite: 43]. |
| **Prompt V4:** "Write a section focused on **AI's role compared to human therapy**. Use a **cautious, balanced tone** emphasizing ethical boundaries." | [cite_start]Output clearly states that AI is **not a replacement** for professional human therapists[cite: 35]. [cite_start]It emphasizes that human professionals are **irreplaceable** for complex mental health conditions, providing the necessary nuanced understanding, empathy, and diagnostic capabilities[cite: 40]. |
